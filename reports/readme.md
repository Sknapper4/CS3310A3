# Instructions
1. Install python 3.7.0
2. run python WMUsearchEngine.py 'FILE_PATH_HERE'
3. Check 'output/results.txt' for time benchmarks
4. Check 'output/url_stack.txt' for the list of urls
    and the search terms that were sent in for them
5. If you need to change the instructions file, 
    the headers.py file contains the path that my program 
    uses.
    
# Decisions
 1. I was unsure of how ? and ! characters were supposed 
    to work in the stack. So I placed these characters into my 
    stack and I stopped printing URLs when the ! was present.
